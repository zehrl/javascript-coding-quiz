## Description

Welcome to the JavaScript Coding Quiz! In this application, you will be asked a series of multiple-choice, JavaScript related questions. You'll be timed when you start the quiz so make sure to answer each question as quickly as you can. Be careful however, as time will be deducted if you answer a question incorrectly. At the end of the quiz, you'll have a chance to save your score and initials. Because the scores & initials are saved on local storage, you can leave the website and come back without losing your highscores.
